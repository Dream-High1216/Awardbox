I mentioned that Sass has some history to it and actually has not one, but two syntaxes. One of the syntaxes is even named "Sass" which adds even more confusion to the mix. The main syntax is referred to as "SCSS" (for "Sassy CSS") and is new as of Sass 3. The older syntax (part of that history I mentioned) is referred to as the indented syntax (or just "Sass"). Now that we've covered a bit of the history of Sass and the fact that it has two syntaxes, I believe we are ready to write some code. Or should I say SCSS – because the SCSS syntax is like CSS and was designed to be a superset of CSS3's syntax. This means that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS. In fact, you can copy the contents of a CSS file and paste it into a SCSS file and Sass will compile it to clean CSS.</div>

Now that we've covered a bit of the history of Sass and the fact that it has two syntaxes, I believe we are ready to write some code.
